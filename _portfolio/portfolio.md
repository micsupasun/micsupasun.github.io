    <td>This application will help the visually impaired to carry out their daily activities without relying so much on others, enabling a more independent life for them. By implementing a federated learning approach, the distributed system of the edge computing devices will reduce the dependency on heavy computing systems required. Our research also aimed to reduce the latency as it is close to the speed of the network. This can be further enhanced by deploying the model to a larger scale which will help to collect more training data and improve the accuracy of the model which is on the cloud.</td>

    <td>The main goal of this project is to use a webcam to capture real-time video feeds and recognize pre-defined faces within the video frames. The project compares faces detected in the video with a set of known faces that have been pre-loaded into the system, and it labels the recognized faces accordingly.</td>

Then, the HandDetector class from the cvzone.HandTrackingModule library is initialized to detect hands in the video frames. The keyboard inputs are captured using the pynput.keyboard.Controller class.</td>
