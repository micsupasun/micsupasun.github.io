In the first step, we used machine learning to predict 9 models, each model using 3 scalars: min_max_scalar,robust_scalar,standard_scalar. This resulted in a total of 27 models, with 14 models outperforming humans. in the second step, We optimize the model to increase accuracy by improving the parameters even further. when we train a model again. We have selected the best parameters and scalar of each model for a total of 9 models. which outperforms the human prediction of 4 models. finally, we use Deep Learning model with Convolution neural network 1 model, which is more efficient than human prediction. With all of the above, we can clearly see that there are 19 models that are accurate enough to be used in real life. The most accurate model was Random Forest, which used the best parameters and scalar with an accuracy of 0.999911 percent and a standard deviation of 0.000050 percent. from the comparison of a test set with a total of 112032 transactions, only 5 transactions have errors. while if humans predict there will be a transaction error is approximately 194 transaction[112032-(112032*99.8272514369/100)].

Therefore, this research is to predict speech emotion recognition to understand human feelings better. There are two types of predictions: just the prediction of emotion and the prediction of emotion and gender. This research was performed by merging four datasets to solve the problem of imbalance and overfitting datasets. The four datasets were then combined and transformed from noise to numbers by Zero Crossing Rate, Root Mean Square, and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient and predicted by 17 models to find the best model. The best model of machine learning from the experiment, Ensemble Learning with soft, had an accuracy of 89.82 percent for predicting only emotion and 88.64 percent for predicting emotion and gender. At the same time, the most accurate deep-learning model is the Convolutional neural network. The accuracy of predicting only emotion was 97.44 percent, and predicting emotion and gender was accurate at 97.35 percent. From this study, we can see that female voices were more accurate than male voices, fear voices were the least accurate, and surprise voices had the greatest predictive accuracy in model predictions.</td>
