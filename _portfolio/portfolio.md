    <td>There are two types of predictions: just the prediction of emotion and the prediction of emotion and gender. This research was performed by merging four datasets to solve the problem of imbalance and overfitting datasets. The four datasets were then combined and transformed from noise to numbers by Zero Crossing Rate, Root Mean Square, and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient and predicted by 17 models to find the best model. The best model of machine learning from the experiment, Ensemble Learning with soft, had an accuracy of 89.82 percent for predicting only emotion and 88.64 percent for predicting emotion and gender. At the same time, the most accurate deep-learning model is the Convolutional neural network. The accuracy of predicting only emotion was 97.44 percent, and predicting emotion and gender was accurate at 97.35 percent. From this study, we can see that female voices were more accurate than male voices, fear voices were the least accurate, and surprise voices had the greatest predictive accuracy in model predictions.</td>
