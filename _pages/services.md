<!-- Paper Reviewing====== -->

<h2>Review</h2>

I am serving as a **Guest Editor** ([service certificate](../files/Editor-Certificate-648661.pdf)) for the MDPI open-access journal Electronics [Q2, h-index 83], Special Issue titled 'Motion-centric Video Processing'. 

I am serving as an **Area Chair** for ACM Multimedia 2024.

I have the honor of serving as an **Area Chair** for the 27th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR 2024) by invitation from [Prof. Cheng-Lin Liu](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/liucl/) (CASIA).

I regularly review technical papers for the following journals, conferences & workshops.
